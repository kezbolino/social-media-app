# CLAUDE.md — Project Memory

Living notes for working in this repo. Update as decisions and gotchas accumulate.

## What this is
"Chuckling Wings — Wingman": an offline-first PWA that helps a street-food trader
build social posts (single photo / collage / carousel), get a pre-written caption
with location & day filled in, and share via the system share sheet. No build step —
plain HTML/CSS/JS that runs by opening `index.html` directly (`file://`) or via a
static server.

## Run / preview
- `npm start` — serves the folder at http://localhost:5173 (via `serve@14`).
- Opening `index.html` directly also works; service worker / installability only
  activate over https or localhost.

## Layout
- `index.html` — all screens live here as `<section class="screen" data-screen="...">`.
  Navigation is data-attribute driven: `data-action`, `data-nav`, `data-back`.
- `css/styles.css` — all styling. Button system: `.btn` + variants
  (`.btn-primary/-secondary/-accent/-ghost`, `.btn-xl` = hero size, `.btn-sm`).
- `js/app.js` — main app logic/router. Other `js/*.js` are focused modules
  (editor, imaging, publish, store, weather, etc.), loaded via `<script>` tags at
  the bottom of `index.html`.
- Bottom nav (`.bottomnav`) is persistent across screens: New post, Calendar,
  Generate, Settings. It is the primary way to reach Calendar & Settings.

## Conventions / gotchas
- Home screen buttons animate in via `.home .btn:nth-of-type(n)` delays — adding/
  removing home buttons shifts those, but it's cosmetic only.
- Back buttons use `class="back"` with just the `‹` glyph (no "Back" text); they
  carry `aria-label="Back"` for screen readers and a 44px min tap target.
- `data-back` value is the screen to return to (empty string = default/home flow).
- Cross-script modules use the `const X = (()=>{})()` IIFE pattern. A top-level
  `const` in a classic `<script>` is a lexical global (reachable by bare name,
  e.g. `Store`, `Photos`) but is NOT a property of `window` — so any
  `if (window.X)` guard needs the module to also do `window.X = X` (see the tail
  of `js/photos.js`, and `window.FX = …` in `js/fx.js`).
- App version string lives in one place: `#appVersion` at the bottom of the home
  screen in index.html (currently `v0.03`).
  - ⭐ **RULE (do this automatically, never ask):** every shipped feature or
    enhancement MUST bump `#appVersion` in the *same* change, before committing.
    Increment the patch (v0.03 → v0.04) for a normal feature/enhancement. The owner
    should never have to ask for a version bump — it just happens.

## Notable changes
- 2026-07-10: Generate screen shows a **"📸 N photos loaded"** note (`#genPoolNote`,
  updated in `refreshPoolUi`, refreshed on `runGenerate`) so the trader can see how
  many photos are in the pool. The "📁 Photo folder" button stays (one-off session
  pick); the saved stash is still the persistent source. Version → v0.07.
- 2026-07-10: Generate captions are now **solid, tilted "sticker" labels** (was a
  feathered bottom banner). New `drawCaptionSticker` in imaging.js draws a solid
  rounded-rect label with a slight rotation (`opts.angle`) and varying font
  (`opts.sizeScale`); `drawCaptionPanel` routes to it when `opts.sticker`. The old
  gradient/scrim banner stays for manual single/collage posts. `CAPTION_STYLES`
  became 5 solid looks; `buildGeneratedPosts` adds per-card angle/size jitter so
  even same-style cards differ. Version → v0.06.
- 2026-07-10: Caption looks now **vary across a batch** instead of always blue/white.
  `drawCaptionPanel` (imaging.js) is parametrised — `fill` (gradient|solid|scrim|none),
  `fillRGB`, `color`, `accent`, `shadow` — and `renderSingle(img, caption, styleOpts)`
  forwards them. `CAPTION_STYLES` in app.js holds 5 on-brand looks (brand-blue,
  orange block, cream/blue, charcoal, minimal scrim); `buildGeneratedPosts` shuffles
  them and rotates one per card. The chosen style is baked into each card's composite
  image, so it carries through to sharing. Version → v0.05.
- 2026-07-10: Swipe-deck posts now have the caption **burnt onto the image**
  (`buildGeneratedPosts` calls `Imaging.renderSingle(img, picked.filledText)` —
  the existing brand-blue panel + white text). The captioned canvas is turned back
  into an `<img>` (`loadImageFromUrl`) and stored as the item's `img`, so the caption
  stays baked in when the post is shared (Post → `buildReview` re-renders that
  composite). Swipe cards now show the whole **square** image (so the bottom caption
  panel isn't cropped — `.gen-deck` uses `aspect-ratio:1/1.14`, `.swipe-card img` is
  square) and only the hashtags sit under it. Version → v0.04.
- 2026-07-10: Generate posts → Tinder-style swipe deck (js/app.js, index.html, css):
  - `buildGeneratedPosts` now makes **up to 10** distinct posts (was 3), decoding a
    few stash photos once and reusing them across varied captions. Each item is
    `{ img, dataUrl, filledText, hook, hashtags }` with the **hashtag block baked in**
    (`buildHashtagBlock(loc)` gained a location arg so it works before a `post` exists).
  - Generate screen replaced the card list with a swipe deck: `#genDeck` renders up
    to 3 stacked `.swipe-card`s; the top card is drag-swipeable (`attachDrag`) —
    right = keep, left = bin — with KEEP/NOPE badges and a springy `flyOff`.
    `♥`/`✕` buttons (`gen-like`/`gen-nope`) do the same and are the reduced-motion /
    a11y path (drag isn't attached when `prefers-reduced-motion`). `#genProgress`
    shows "n / total". Loading uses the `loading` mascot; empty/None states use
    `relaxing`/`confused`/`sad` mascots. Panels toggled via `genShow(which)`.
  - Binned captions go in a session `binnedHookIds` set so "New batch" won't resurface
    them. Keepers pile into `keepers`; `showKeepers()` renders a tray where each has
    **Post** (`postKeeper` → `buildReview` → review/share) and **Customise**
    (`customiseKeeper` → caption editor). `seedPostFromGen` builds the live `post`
    for both. `buildReview` now resets the review back-arrow to `caption` (keeper Post
    overrides it to `generate`).
- 2026-07-10: Mascot moods — the Chuckling Wings chicken as dynamic feedback:
  - `assets/mascot/` — 12 transparent PNG poses sliced from the owner's 1024×1024
    sprite sheet (a 4×3 grid). Names match what each shows: `idle`, `loading`
    (laptop + coffee + checkmark bubbles), `thinking` (lightbulb), `celebrate`
    (wings up + confetti), `sleeping` (Zzz), `relaxing` (armchair), `singing`
    (music note), `confused` (?), `thumbsup`, `sad`, `excited` (sparkles),
    `waving`. Each ≤ ~272px longest side, ~50–95KB, ~816KB total.
  - Slicing was done offline in headless Chromium (no ImageMagick/PIL here): the
    sheet has NO alpha (opaque light/white bg), so background was removed by a
    border flood-fill (edge-connected bright/neutral pixels → transparent), which
    keeps enclosed light props (laptop, pillow, coffee, checkmark bubbles) intact.
    Then hand-tuned per-pose crop boxes (cut lines in the true gutters) so no
    neighbour bleeds in. Slice script lives in the session scratchpad, not the repo.
  - `js/mascot.js` — tiny `Mascot` helper (loaded before app.js, exposes
    `window.Mascot`): `Mascot.url/html/el/set`, friendly per-state alt text, and
    animation classes. Pure presentation, offline-safe.
  - Where states are wired: LOADING = Generate "Cooking up posts…" (bob);
    SUCCESS = `#celebrateMascot` on the Review screen, shown in `markPostShared`
    alongside `FX.confetti` and reset in `buildReview`; EMPTY STATES via the
    `mascotEmpty()` helper — Generate (relaxing), Queue (sleeping), Run-it-back
    (sad), and the photo-stash grid (relaxing); GREETING = `#homeMascot` waving
    above the home greeting (the logo.svg stays the main brand mark).
  - CSS (`css/styles.css`, mascot block before the reduced-motion block): sized
    by height with `width:auto` so varied pose aspect ratios never distort;
    motions `mascot-bob/float/sway/spin/pop` — all disabled in the
    `prefers-reduced-motion` block (extended to cover them).
- 2026-07-10: Persistent photo stash + version number:
  - `js/photos.js` — a small IndexedDB module (`Photos.add/all/count/remove/clear`,
    `Photos.supported`) storing image blobs on the device. localStorage can't hold
    blobs; IndexedDB can. Loaded before app.js in index.html; exposed via
    `window.Photos`.
  - Settings "📸 My chicken photos" section: add photos once (multi-select), saved
    on the device, shown as a thumbnail grid with ✕ remove + "Clear all"
    (`renderStash`, `onStashPicked`, `removeStashPhoto`, `clearStash`,
    `data-stash-remove`). On boot `loadPhotoStash()` seeds the in-memory `photoPool`
    from the stash so shuffle/generate work with no re-picking each session.
  - Why a stash and not a real folder: phone browsers can't bind to a live device
    folder (no persistent directory access on iOS Safari), so a saved stash is the
    offline-first stand-in for "point at my chicken pics, grab at random".
  - IndexedDB gotcha: a transaction goes inactive once control returns to the event
    loop, so `photos.js` creates each transaction and issues all its requests
    synchronously (no await between) and resolves on `tx.oncomplete` — don't
    `await` a store handle and then write to it.
  - Home screen shows `v0.01` (`.app-version`, `#appVersion`).
- 2026-07-09: Duolingo-style animation pass ("juice" layer, css/styles.css + js/fx.js):
- 2026-07-09: Duolingo-style animation pass ("juice" layer, css/styles.css + js/fx.js):
  - New FX helpers: `FX.sparkle(el)` (small quiet confetti puff + pop at an
    element — used for everyday wins) and `FX.wiggle(el)` (one-shot shimmy for
    errors/nudges). `FX.confetti` gained `quiet`/`power` opts; the full
    chime + big burst stays reserved for sharing a post.
  - Marking a working day / adding a place on the calendar sparkles the day's
    cell (`celebrateWorkday`); queue-add sparkles the button; new settings
    rows/hashtags pop in; validation errors wiggle.
  - CSS: staggered rise-ins for tiles, gen/history cards, queue & settings
    rows; chips bounce in with a stagger (`fx-chip-in`); calendar cells squash
    on press and the day panel springs up (`fx-spring-up`); bottom-nav icon
    bounces on tab change (`fx-nav-pop`); back arrows, editor tabs and collage
    slots got springy presses; home hero CTA has a soft pulse-ring on
    `::after` (a pseudo-element so it never fights the transform animations).
  - Gotcha fixed: entrance animations must use fill-mode `backwards`, NOT
    `both` — a forwards fill keeps overriding `transform` after the animation
    ends, which froze the buttons' 3D press-down on the home screen.
  - Pre-existing bug fixed: the calendar "Add another place…" input lacked
    `min-width: 0`, so its flex row overflowed 390px viewports and focusing it
    silently scrolled `#app` sideways; `#app` now also uses `overflow-x: clip`
    (with `hidden` as the fallback) so nothing can shove it off-axis.
  - All new animations are disabled in the `prefers-reduced-motion` block at
    the bottom of styles.css — keep adding new ones there.
- 2026-07-09: Home screen decluttered — removed Calendar & Settings buttons from the
  home list (still reachable via bottom nav). "+ New Post" dropped `.btn-xl` so it
  matches the other home buttons. Back buttons stripped to arrow-only with aria-label.
- 2026-07-09: Work calendar upgrades (`renderCalendar`/`selectCalDay` in app.js):
  - "Working days in <month>" quick-remove list under the grid (`#calWorkdays`,
    `renderWorkdaysList`) — each day is a chip; tap it to jump, tap its ✕ to
    un-mark (`removeWorkday`). data-attrs `data-cal-day` / `data-cal-remove`.
  - Tapping a day now shows what's lined up (`#calDaySchedule`,
    `renderCalDaySchedule`): queued plans (from `Store.getQueue()`, matched on
    `date`) and already-posted posts that day (shared posts matched on `created`).
  - Day panel has an inline "Add another place…" input (`#calDayAddLoc`,
    `addCalDayLocation`, action `cal-add-loc`) that saves a new pitch via
    `Store.addLocation` and sets it for the day in one go. Note: the location
    chips list only what's in `Store.getLocations()`; if a user only sees one, their
    saved list is short — the add-place input is how they grow it.
