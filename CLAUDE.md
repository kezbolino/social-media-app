# CLAUDE.md — Project Memory

Living notes for working in this repo. Update as decisions and gotchas accumulate.

## What this is
"Chuckling Wings — Wingman": an offline-first PWA that helps a street-food trader
build social posts (single photo / collage / carousel), get a pre-written caption
with location & day filled in, and share via the system share sheet. No build step —
plain HTML/CSS/JS that runs by opening `index.html` directly (`file://`) or via a
static server.

## Run / preview
- `npm start` — serves the folder at http://localhost:5173 (via `serve@14`).
- Opening `index.html` directly also works; service worker / installability only
  activate over https or localhost.

## Layout
- `index.html` — all screens live here as `<section class="screen" data-screen="...">`.
  Navigation is data-attribute driven: `data-action`, `data-nav`, `data-back`.
- `css/styles.css` — all styling. Button system: `.btn` + variants
  (`.btn-primary/-secondary/-accent/-ghost`, `.btn-xl` = hero size, `.btn-sm`).
- `js/app.js` — main app logic/router. Other `js/*.js` are focused modules
  (editor, imaging, publish, store, weather, etc.), loaded via `<script>` tags at
  the bottom of `index.html`.
- Bottom nav (`.bottomnav`) is persistent across screens: New post, Calendar,
  Generate, Settings. It is the primary way to reach Calendar & Settings.

## Conventions / gotchas
- Home screen buttons animate in via `.home .btn:nth-of-type(n)` delays — adding/
  removing home buttons shifts those, but it's cosmetic only.
- Back buttons use `class="back"` with just the `‹` glyph (no "Back" text); they
  carry `aria-label="Back"` for screen readers and a 44px min tap target.
- `data-back` value is the screen to return to (empty string = default/home flow).
- Cross-script modules use the `const X = (()=>{})()` IIFE pattern. A top-level
  `const` in a classic `<script>` is a lexical global (reachable by bare name,
  e.g. `Store`, `Photos`) but is NOT a property of `window` — so any
  `if (window.X)` guard needs the module to also do `window.X = X` (see the tail
  of `js/photos.js`, and `window.FX = …` in `js/fx.js`).
- App version string lives in one place: `#appVersion` at the bottom of the home
  screen in index.html (currently `v0.01`). Bump it there.

## Notable changes
- 2026-07-10: Persistent photo stash + version number:
  - `js/photos.js` — a small IndexedDB module (`Photos.add/all/count/remove/clear`,
    `Photos.supported`) storing image blobs on the device. localStorage can't hold
    blobs; IndexedDB can. Loaded before app.js in index.html; exposed via
    `window.Photos`.
  - Settings "📸 My chicken photos" section: add photos once (multi-select), saved
    on the device, shown as a thumbnail grid with ✕ remove + "Clear all"
    (`renderStash`, `onStashPicked`, `removeStashPhoto`, `clearStash`,
    `data-stash-remove`). On boot `loadPhotoStash()` seeds the in-memory `photoPool`
    from the stash so shuffle/generate work with no re-picking each session.
  - Why a stash and not a real folder: phone browsers can't bind to a live device
    folder (no persistent directory access on iOS Safari), so a saved stash is the
    offline-first stand-in for "point at my chicken pics, grab at random".
  - IndexedDB gotcha: a transaction goes inactive once control returns to the event
    loop, so `photos.js` creates each transaction and issues all its requests
    synchronously (no await between) and resolves on `tx.oncomplete` — don't
    `await` a store handle and then write to it.
  - Home screen shows `v0.01` (`.app-version`, `#appVersion`).
- 2026-07-09: Duolingo-style animation pass ("juice" layer, css/styles.css + js/fx.js):
- 2026-07-09: Duolingo-style animation pass ("juice" layer, css/styles.css + js/fx.js):
  - New FX helpers: `FX.sparkle(el)` (small quiet confetti puff + pop at an
    element — used for everyday wins) and `FX.wiggle(el)` (one-shot shimmy for
    errors/nudges). `FX.confetti` gained `quiet`/`power` opts; the full
    chime + big burst stays reserved for sharing a post.
  - Marking a working day / adding a place on the calendar sparkles the day's
    cell (`celebrateWorkday`); queue-add sparkles the button; new settings
    rows/hashtags pop in; validation errors wiggle.
  - CSS: staggered rise-ins for tiles, gen/history cards, queue & settings
    rows; chips bounce in with a stagger (`fx-chip-in`); calendar cells squash
    on press and the day panel springs up (`fx-spring-up`); bottom-nav icon
    bounces on tab change (`fx-nav-pop`); back arrows, editor tabs and collage
    slots got springy presses; home hero CTA has a soft pulse-ring on
    `::after` (a pseudo-element so it never fights the transform animations).
  - Gotcha fixed: entrance animations must use fill-mode `backwards`, NOT
    `both` — a forwards fill keeps overriding `transform` after the animation
    ends, which froze the buttons' 3D press-down on the home screen.
  - Pre-existing bug fixed: the calendar "Add another place…" input lacked
    `min-width: 0`, so its flex row overflowed 390px viewports and focusing it
    silently scrolled `#app` sideways; `#app` now also uses `overflow-x: clip`
    (with `hidden` as the fallback) so nothing can shove it off-axis.
  - All new animations are disabled in the `prefers-reduced-motion` block at
    the bottom of styles.css — keep adding new ones there.
- 2026-07-09: Home screen decluttered — removed Calendar & Settings buttons from the
  home list (still reachable via bottom nav). "+ New Post" dropped `.btn-xl` so it
  matches the other home buttons. Back buttons stripped to arrow-only with aria-label.
- 2026-07-09: Work calendar upgrades (`renderCalendar`/`selectCalDay` in app.js):
  - "Working days in <month>" quick-remove list under the grid (`#calWorkdays`,
    `renderWorkdaysList`) — each day is a chip; tap it to jump, tap its ✕ to
    un-mark (`removeWorkday`). data-attrs `data-cal-day` / `data-cal-remove`.
  - Tapping a day now shows what's lined up (`#calDaySchedule`,
    `renderCalDaySchedule`): queued plans (from `Store.getQueue()`, matched on
    `date`) and already-posted posts that day (shared posts matched on `created`).
  - Day panel has an inline "Add another place…" input (`#calDayAddLoc`,
    `addCalDayLocation`, action `cal-add-loc`) that saves a new pitch via
    `Store.addLocation` and sets it for the day in one go. Note: the location
    chips list only what's in `Store.getLocations()`; if a user only sees one, their
    saved list is short — the add-place input is how they grow it.
